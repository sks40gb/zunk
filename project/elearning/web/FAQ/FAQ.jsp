      <p>eLearning is Internet-enabled learning. Components can include content 
        delivery in multiple formats, management of the learning experience, and 
        a networked community of learners, content developers and experts. eLearning 
        provides faster learning at reduced costs, increased access to learning, 
        and clear accountability for all participants in the learning process. 
        In today's fast-paced culture, organizations that implement eLearning 
        provide their work force with the ability to turn change into an advantage.

        <li>Take advantage of the net: real-time, 24/7, anywhere, anytime</li>
        <li>Bring people together to collaborate and learn together</li>
        <li>Personalize, often by combining "learning objects" on the 
          fly</li>
        <li>Offer more than one learning method, e.g. virtual classroom and simulation 
          and self-paced instruction</li>
        <li>Incorporate administrative functions such as registration, payment 
          and charge-backs, monitoring learner progress, testing, and maintaining

<h2>Does it matter? </h2>
<table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="6" width="90%">

    <td bgcolor="#ffffff" width="70%"> <h3>E-business.</h3>
      <p>Change is rampant. It's the Knowledge Era, New Economy, Internet Age, 
        Information Revolution, yadda, yadda, yadda. Brains have replaced brawn. 
      </p>
      <p>Networked organizations demand rapid-fire, front-line decisions, and 
        people must be in the know to make them. Everything's converging or already 
        networked, cycle times are speeding up, and competition is coming from 
        all directions. Are you ready?</p>
      <p>Staffing for eBusiness is a make/buy decision. </p>
      <p>Buying is pricey and shortsighted. (Techies with tongue-studs and purple 
        hair command six-figure salaries, and there are too few of them to go 
        around. We're short half a million high-tech workers, and business gets 
        more techie every day.) <b>Buying talent is not like buying tools. The 
        shelf-life of knowledge has dwindled to the point that a four-year engineering 
        degree is obsolete in, well, about four years.</b></p>
      <p>People once agonized over career decisions for fear of looking like "job 
        hoppers." These days they hear about a new opportunity over lunch 
        and go to work for a competitor that afternoon. Money doesn't necessarily 
        talk to a young person who drives a Porsche. What keeps people on board 
        these days is the opportunity to develop, to build valued skills, to achieve 
        certifications, and to add to their store of intellectual capital. </p>
      <p>Learning has become a vital business function, but old-style training 
        can't keep pace with Internet time. Traditional workshops cost a fortune 
        in airplane tickets and time away from the job. In the eyes of many senior 
        managers, off-site workshops have always been somewhere between a total 
        waste of time and a boondoggle, the "great training robbery." 
        Training has grown too important to be delegated to training departments. 
      </p>
      <p>eLearning is attractive to corporations because it promises better use 
        of time, accelerated learning, global reach, fast pace, and accountability. 
        It's manageable. It cuts paperwork and administrative overhead. Sometimes 
        it can be outsourced, providing more time for leveraging the organization's 
        core competence. eLearners like it, too. </p>

        to time and space, believing that as long as the job gets done on time, 
        it is not important where or when it gets done. B the same token, they

    <td bordercolor="#CCCCCC" bgcolor="#ffffff" width="70%"> <h3>Different perspectives</h3>
      <p>eLearning is like a cubist painting. To make sense of it, you need to 
        look at it from different perspectives. </p>
      <p>From the <b>philosophical</b> viewpoint, eLearning is framed by the principles 
        and practices of the eLearning community -- a mix of social concern, instructional 
        design, software savvy, entrepreneurial zeal, and extreme dissatisfaction 
        with the status quo. Another view looks to the <b>components</b> of eLearning 
        -- collaboration, simulation, databases, and so forth. The <b>eBusiness 
        perspective</b> relates eLearning to ERP, supply chain optimization, and 
        disintermediation. </p>
      <h3>Philosophy</h3>
      <p>eLearning is <b>revolutionary</b>. As Nicholas Negroponte says, incrementalism 
        is innovation's worst enemy. The Internet changes everything; education 
        and training are about to be changed. Radically. It's time for a fresh 
        approach. </p>
      <p>eLearning focuses on the individual learner. For years, training has 
        organized itself for the convenience and needs of instructors, institutions, 
        and bureaucracies. Bad attitude. Think of learners as customers. Compete 
        for their time and interests. Provide them legendary service. Convert 
        them into raving fans. Give them choices. Don't make them reinvent the 
        wheel.</p>

        is <b>forever</b>. Continuous education. The forty-year degree. Daily 
        learning. Work becomes learning, learning becomes work, and nobody ever 
        graduates. </p>
      <p>Performance is the goal. The objective is to <b>become competent in the 
        least time and with the least amount of training</b>. If people could 
        take a smart pill instead of logging in to class, bravo! How long is this 
        going to take? No more credit for seat-time. </p>
      <p>Most<b> learning is social</b>. The coffee room is a more effective place 
        to learn than the classroom. Studies reveal that the majority of corporate 
        learning is informal, i.e. outside of class. eLearning seeks to foster 
        collaboration and peer interaction. </p>
      <p>A classic study at Standard found that Hewlett Packard engineers who 
        watched videotaped lectures followed by informal discussion performed 
        better than Stanford engineering students who attended the same lectures 
        on campus. Instead of an on-campus lecturer pouring content into students' 
        heads, the HP engineers were challenged to construct their own interpretation 
        of the subject matter. </p>

        about its users and tailors its offerings to their learning style, job 
        requirements, career goals, current knowledge, and personal preferences. 
        &lt;buzzword alert&gt; Small chunks of learning (granules, objects) are 
        labeled (metatagged within IMS standards) so systems can automatically 
        mix and match them to assemble and deliver individualized learning experiences.

          be via book or CD or video or what have you)</p>
        <p>1:many<b> virtual events</b> (which could take place in virtual classroom, 
          virtual lecture hall, or expert-led discussion)</p>
        <p>1:1 <b>mentoring </b>(which might entail coaching, help desk, office 
          hours, periodic check-in, email exchanges)</p>
        <p><b>simulation</b>, because we learn by doing. Learners from all over 
          the globe experiment on millions of dollars worth of routers and bridges 
          at Mentor Labs. Consultants learn about eBusiness from a game developed 
          by SMGnet. </p>
        <p><b>collaboration</b>, either joint problem-solving or discussion among 
          study groups via discussion groups and chat rooms</p>
        <p><b>live workshops</b> (yes, the old way), for some topics are best 
          taught in the real world by a flesh-and-blood instructor or expert</p>
        <p><b>assessment</b>, both for initial placement and for opting out of 
          topics the learner has already mastered</p>
        <p><b>competency roadmap</b>, a custom learning plan based on job, career, 
          and personal goals</p>
        <p><b>authoring</b> tools, to develop and update content</p>

      <p>It doesn&#8217;t have to be this way. Managers must go the extra mile to pat 
        learners on the back, give them recognition, and encourage them to learn 
        with their peers. eLearners are customers; they continually need to be 
        sold. </p>
      <p>Finally, eLearning is not for everyone. Some people simply will not learn 
        outside of a classroom. </p>
      <h3>Learning to the desktop</h3>
      <p>This is one of those benefits that's better in theory than in practice. 
        Learning complex subjects requires concentration. Most people's desks 
        are less than optimal for learning (and often for working, too, but that's 
        another matter). </p>
      <p>Buddha was right. "When you do something, do it as if it were all 
        that mattered." Get away from the phone. Shelter yourself from colleagues. 
        Go to a learning cubicle. Put up a "Do Not Disturb" sign. </p>

        got the solution -- take it all home." As if there aren't distractions 
        aplenty at home. Feed the baby, watch the game, talk with the spouse, 
        have a beer on the patio, or log in for learning? Besides, what message 
        does the boss communicate about the value of learning if he expects people 
        to do it on their own time?</p></td>

    <td valign="top" width="34%"> <p>Certain content -- because of its nature, 
        relative value, or importance -- is not suitable for technology-based 
        delivery. While online training is especially well suited for the acquisition 
        of IT skills, it has certain limitations in the arena of soft skills training. 
        Other educational content that does not translate well into a virtual 
        environment is material requiring significant hands-on application, with 
        a strong emphasis on peer review and collaboration. </p>

      <p>A horrific pitfall has turned out to be cajolling workers to participate. 
        One third to one half of workers never register to take part. Half to 
        three-quarters of those who start a program drop out before completing 
        it. I've just completed a</a> on how to

    <td bgcolor="#ffffff" width="70%"> <h3>Short term</h3>
      <p>Corporations increasingly outsource training to Learning Service Providers 
        (think Application Service Provider + Learning).</p>
      <p>Standards-based learning management systems assemble large-grain learning 
        objects on the fly. (XML meets learning). </p>
      <p>Learner relationship management mirrors customer relationship management. 
      </p>
      <p>ERP and CRM vendors replace learning management systems as learning is 
        recognized as an enterprise application.</p>

      <h3>Longer term</h3>
      <p>"Intelligent" interfaces learn about the eLearner over time. 
        (Apple's Knowledge Navigator finally arrives, only twenty years late.) 
      </p>
      <p>Learning becomes imbedded in work processes and equipment. </p>
      <p>Economies of scale will development of "cool" learning using 
        rich media, popular entertainers, and game interfaces. </p>
