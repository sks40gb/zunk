                                    Guru Ghasidas Vishwavidyalaya Bilaspur  has played an important role in enhancing higher education for the last
                                    two and half decades. It provides immense scope, not only for excellence in academic achievements, but also in
                                    the development of human resources with contemporary requirements. This is the place, above all, for students
                                    with inquisitive minds who want to expand their mental horizons and interest in specific academic disciplines.
                                    The university array of academic resources combined with its faculties provides an important focus for the
                                    exchange and development of ideas in the fields of science & technology, business studies, medical education,
                                    life sciences, natural sciences, social sciences, arts and humanities, information technology, law, physical
                                    education, etc. Providing quality education with equity has been our motto throughout. While the university
                                    brings together a blend of resources for academic, cultural and intellectual development, it is a students
                                    commitment to his/her own potential that can take maximum benefit from them.

                                With the upgradation of university as Central University, the challenges have also increased and so do
                                expectations all around. As a devoted part of this university, let us work hard to bring the quality and
                                reputation of the university in the front row of leading universities in the world. I am sure that the
