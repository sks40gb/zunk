1. If you want to implement any data structure which follow FIFO use LinkedList since no re-arrangement needs to be done.
2. If you want to implement any data structure which follow LIFO use Array since no re-arrangement is required.

Ex : Stack Implementation can use Array  with method
        Push
        Pop
        Peek

Ex2: Queue can use LinkedList since it uses FIFO. it should have method - 
        enqueue(E item)
        dequeue() 
        hasItems()
        size()
