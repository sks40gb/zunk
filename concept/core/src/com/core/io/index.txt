InputStreamReader - It convert InputStream to Reader so it can be used as Reader

BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
String line = bufferedReader.readLine();

Scanner - to scan content, separated by white space. It can get the primitive data type by using scanner.hasNext() and scanner.next()
PrintStream -

System.out - is a PrintStream



What are filter streams?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Filter streams are a category of IO streams whose responsibility is to add extra functionality (advantage) to the 
existing streams like giving line numbers in the destination file that do not exist in the source file or increasing 
performance of copying etc.


What is PrintStream and PrintWriter?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Functionally both are same but belong to two different categories â€“ byte streams and character streams. 
println() method exists in both classes.


What is RandomAccessFile?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is a special class from java.io package which is neither a input stream nor a output stream (because it can do both).
 It is directly a subclass of Object class. Generally, a stream does only one purpose of either reading or writing; 
but RandomAccessFile can do both reading from a file and writing to a file. All the methods of DataInputStream and 
DataOutStream exist in RandomAccessFile.


* In case of BufferedStream always flush or close otherwise you could lose the some of data which are cached in Buffer.
