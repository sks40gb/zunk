How do you find if a number is a power of two, without using arithmetic operator? (solution)

Assume it's a question of using the bitwise operator as soon as you hear restriction about not allowed to use 
arithmetic operator. If that restriction is not in place then you can easily check if a number is a power of two by
using modulus and division operator. By the using bitwise operator, there is a nice trick to do this.  You can use
following code to check if a number if power of two or not

public static boolean powerOfTwo(int x) {
        return (x & (x - 1)) == 0;
}
